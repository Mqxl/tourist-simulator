# Discrete Event Simulation Example

This repository contains both the Python logic for running
simulations as well as the HTML5 canvas-based visualization.

The standalone Python simulation can be found in `simpy example.py`,
and the HTML visualization logic is contained in `visualize.html`
and `tour_visualization.ts`. Running `tsc` will compile the Typescript and
output `tour_visualization.js`.
